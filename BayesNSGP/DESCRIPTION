Title: Bayesian Analysis of Non-Stationary Gaussian Process Models
Description: Enables off-the-shelf functionality for fully Bayesian, nonstationary Gaussian process modeling. The approach to nonstationary modeling involves a closed-form, convolution-based covariance function with spatially-varying parameters; these parameter processes can be specified either deterministically (using covariates or basis functions) or stochastically (using approximate Gaussian processes). Stationary Gaussian processes are a special case of our methodology, and we furthermore implement approximate Gaussian process inference to account for very large spatial data sets (Finley, et al (2017) <arXiv:1702.00434v2>). Bayesian inference is carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods via the 'nimble' package, and posterior prediction for the Gaussian process at unobserved locations is provided as a post-processing step.
